# How Representative Is Your Government?  

The project [How Representative Is Your Government?](https://stories.thedataproject.net/docs/5-parliament-content/) aims to see how often members of parliament in Canada vote strictly along party lines, and how often they cast votes independently of their parties,thinking more about their own constituents, which would include: scraping data from a single vote, and automating vote tabulation.
